# amp-templates

App templates made for [AMP](https://github.com/CubeCoders/AMP) that aren't in there by default

## Known issues

* There appears to be a bug where there's a 'ghost' update process that doesnt stop unless you restart the instance.

* The checkbox option 'secure' doesn not work due to a bug in checkbox inputs. If you want a value different to default manually edit the serverconfig.txt.
